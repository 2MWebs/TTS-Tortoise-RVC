# AI Voice Cloning

> **Note** I do not plan on actively working on improvements/enhancements for this project, this is mainly meant to keep the repo in a working state in the case the original git.ecker goes down or necessary package changes need to be made.

This repo is a fork/reupload of the one originally located here: https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning.  All of the work that was put into it to incoporate training with DLAS and inference with Tortoise belong to mrq, the author of the original ai-voice-cloning repo.
